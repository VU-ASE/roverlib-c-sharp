# Installation

This library needs to be installed manually by downloading the latest [release](https://github.com/VU-ASE/roverlib-c-sharp/releases) and extracting it to a known location. Then, that location needs to be updated in the project file of the consuming C# program. See the [service-template](https://github.com/VU-ASE/service-template-c-sharp/blob/main/README.md) for details.
